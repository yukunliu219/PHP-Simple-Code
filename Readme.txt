This is the part of my analytic microservice that one hundred present written by me using the PHP Laravel framework during last Summer intern. 

The main feature is to send reports like sales report and customer report to company Slack daily or weekly.

The "app" folder contains function code. The "unit" folder contains the unit test code.
